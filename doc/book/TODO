== Scaffold Interface

Consider, should the scaffolds use the traditional

    sow <type> <dir>

Instead of having to change into a pre-created dir?

But evey generator could use an --output option to
redirect results. This could be used:

    sow <type> <name> --output name

And we could add a "shortcut".

    sow <type> <name>/

Where the end '/' indicates that the name is also the output.
