<!--1--------------- OVERVIEW ------------------->

<div id="overview" class="section">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Sow is a project scaffolding generator. Techincally it is a simple,
plugable templating system based on eRuby, but it is designed with
project scaffolding squarely in mind.</p>

</div>


<!--2--------------- INSTALL ------------------->

<div id="install" class="section">

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Install using RubyGems as you would expect:</p>

<pre>
  $ gem install sow
</pre>

<p>Manual site installation can be achived via Ruby Setup. Please see the
<a href="http://rdoc/README.html">README</a> included in the 
<a href="http://">tarball</a> for more information.</p>

</div>


<!--3--------------- USAGE ------------------->

<div id="usage" class="section">

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To start a new Ruby project simply use:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow --ruby=myapp
</pre>

<p>You will see the following outout:</p>

<pre>
  Transferring ruby files to myapp/:

      create  bin
      create  data
      create  doc
      create  doc
      create  lib
      create  lib/myapp
      create  meta
      create  test
      create  HISTORY.rdoc
      create  COPYING.rdoc
      create  README.rdoc
      create  meta/authors
      create  meta/created
      create  meta/description
      create  meta/email
      create  meta/homepage
      create  meta/license
      create  meta/package
      create  meta/repository
      create  meta/title
      create  meta/version

  You need to fix the occurances of &#8216;__FIX__&#8217; in the following files:

      README
      meta/description
</pre>

<!--
<p>Notice the mention of &#8216;reap/**/*&#8217;. By default Sow scaffolds-out
a project layout suited to use by Reap build system. This is a good project
layout even if you aren&#8217;t using Reap, but you may want to add a
standard Rakefile. You can do that will Sow:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow ruby/Rakefile myapp
</pre>

<p>On the other hand if you just want an old-fashioned Ruby project,
you can do:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow ruby myapp
</pre>
-->

<p>With you project setup, be sure to go over the contents and fine-tune it.
In particular, edit all the files that contain &#8216;__FIX__&#8217; entries.</p>

<!--
<p>Sow can continue to be used for in-project templates. To do this, add
templates to the temps/ or admin/temps directories, reflecting the same
layout of your project. For example:</p>

<pre>
  myapp/
    lib/
      myapp/
        myapp.rb
    temps/
      lib/
        myapp/
          myapp.rb.erb
    meta/
      ...
</pre>

<p>Change into your project directory and run:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow
</pre>

<p>Project files will be generated based on the templates and metadata
entries.</p>
-->
</div>


<!--4--------------- HOE USERS ------------------->

<div id="overview" class="section">

<h2>Hoe Users</h2>

<p>Hoe users will notice that the sow command that comes with Hoe is
overwritten by Sow. Sow supports Hoe projects, so there is nothing lost.
Simply use:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow --hoe [directory]
</pre>

<p>Note that the Hoe scaffold does not support the Till out of the box.
To get that you need to create a <code>.meta</code> direcroty in your project.</p>

</div>


<!--5--------------- PLUGINS ------------------->

<div id="plugins" class="section">

<h2>Designing Sow Plugins</h2>

<p>Creating your own plugin is actually quite easy. You simply need
to add a folder to a Ruby project's loadpath following the naming
convention <code>&lt;name&gt;.sow/</code>. This folder can be in
a dedicate project or part of another project. Typically your
project's loadpath with be under <code>lib/</code>. Let's say you want to call
you plugin <code>mohgee</code>, so you would have <code>lib/mohgee.sow</code>
directory in your project. Aternatively you can make a separate folder for
plugins, and add it's path to your project's loadpath (which
is what I do). In that case you might have a folder with a pathname
of <code>plug/moghee.sow</code>.</p>

<p>Within this folder you simply put whatever files you want
to be apart of your scaffolding, using <code>erb</code> within them
when they need to contain dynamically generated content.</p>

<p>Finally you need to add a <code>script.sow.rb</code> file to the
folder. This script instructs Sow on how to conduct the file
transfer and generation when the plugin is used. Essentailly, a Sow
script is a small Ruby DSL script. There are only a few methods you
need to know in order to create you own plugin.</p>

<p>Below is the <code>script.sow.rb</code> for the Ruby plugin.
It covers the majority of available options.</p>

<pre>
  about "Scaffold a traditional ruby project."

  usage "--ruby[=&lt;package-name&gt;]"

  argument(:name, 'package name of new application/library') do |val|
    val = val || pathname
    abort "Name is required." unless val
    metadata.package = val
  end

  scaffold do
    copy('**/*', '.')
    copy('.meta/*', metadir)
  end
</pre>

<p></p>

<h3>Two Years?</h3>
<p>Can you believe it's been two years? Over two years since I began this
crazy eyed journey to create the ultimate Ruby build tool. If I had any idea what I was
getting myself into I would likely have ran away screaming, thankful for having saved myself
an extrodinarily amount of <i>time</i>. Thankfully I can finally say that day has 
almost arrived. And about time too. I was starting to get worried ;) The final result turned out
to be just a single project, rather three came from the edeavor: Ratch, Sow and Reap.</p>
