<h1>Sow</h1>

<h3>Tending Project Ecology</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Sow is a project scaffolding generator. Techincally it is a simple
templating system based on eRuby, but it is designed with project
templating squarely in mind.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Install using RubyGems as you would expect:</p>

<pre>
  $ gem install sow
</pre>

<p>There is no manual install at the moment. This will be fixed in a future
release.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To start a new project simply use:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow myapp
</pre>

<p>You will see the following outout:</p>

<pre>
  Transferring reap/**/* to myapp/:

      create  CHANGES
      create  COPYING
      create  NOTES
      create  README
      create  admin
      create  admin/config
      create  admin/pkg
      create  admin/temps
      create  admin/temps/lib
      create  admin/temps/lib/myapp
      create  admin/temps/lib/myapp/about.rb.erb
      create  admin/web
      create  bin
      create  data
      create  doc
      create  doc/rdoc
      create  doc/ri
      create  lib
      create  lib/my-app
      create  meta
      create  meta/authors
      create  meta/created
      create  meta/description
      create  meta/email
      create  meta/homepage
      create  meta/license
      create  meta/name
      create  meta/repository
      create  meta/status
      create  meta/title
      create  meta/version
      create  test

  You need to fix the occurances of 'FIX' in the following files:

      README
      meta/description
</pre>

<p>Notice the mention of &#8216;reap/**/*&#8217;. By default Sow scaffolds-out
a project layout suited to use by Reap build system. This is a good project
layout even if you aren&#8217;t using Reap, but you may want to add a
standard Rakefile. You can do that will Sow:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow ruby/Rakefile myapp
</pre>

<p>On the other hand if you just want an old-fashioned Ruby project,
you can do:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow ruby myapp
</pre>

<p>You can change the default project type by editing
$HOME/.etc/sow/default_type.</p>

<p>With you project setup, be sure to go over the contents and fine-tune it.
In particular, edit the files that contain &#8216;FIX&#8217; entries.</p>

<p>Sow can continue to be used for in-project templates. To do this, add
templates to the temps/ or admin/temps directories, reflecting the same
layout of your project. For example:</p>

<pre>
  myapp/
    lib/
      myapp/
        myapp.rb
    temps/
      lib/
        myapp/
          myapp.rb.erb
    meta/
      ...
</pre>

<p>Change into your project directory and run:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow
</pre>

<p>Project files will be generated based on the templates and metadata
entries.</p>

<h2>Hoe Users</h2>

<p>Hoe users will notice that the sow command that comes with Hoe is
overwritten, by Sow. Sow support Hoe projects, so there is nothing lost.
Simply use:</p>

<pre>
  $ sow hoe [directory]
</pre>

<p>Or, to use Hoe as the default edit $HOME/.etc/sow/default_type to contain
the work Hoe. Note, the Hoe scaffolding does not support the in-project
templating system. To get that you need to create a meta/ direcroty in your
project, and a place to store templates, eg. temps/.</p>

<h3>Two Years?</h3>
<p>Can you believe it's been two years? Over two years since I began this
crazy eyed journey to create the ultimate Ruby build tool. If I had any idea what I was
getting myself into I would likely have ran away screaming, thankful for having saved myself
an extrodinarily amount of <i>time</i>. Thankfully I can finally say that day has 
almost arrived. And about time too. I was starting to get worried ;) The final result turned out
to be just a single project, rather three came from the edeavor: Ratch, Sow and Reap.</p>
