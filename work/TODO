= TODO List

== Statics

Allow for a static/ directory in a plugin. The files in
this directory will be copied verbatim.


== Partials

Scaffolds themselves support partial scaffolding when sow is in
generation mode. For instance you may want to add a standard
Rakefile. You can do that with Sow:

  $ sow --ruby[Rakefile]

== Till ?

Sow can also be used for general project templating. To do this, add
template files to the temps/ directory, reflecting the
same layout of your project. For example:

  myapp/
    lib/
      myapp/
        myapp.rb
    temps/
      lib/
        myapp/
          myapp.rb.erb
    meta/
      ...

Change into your project directory and type @sow@ with no arguments.

  $ sow

Project files will be generated based on the templates and your porjects
metadata.
