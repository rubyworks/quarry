= Sow -- Tending Project Ecology

* http://proutils.rubyforge.org/sow


== Introduction

Sow is a scaffold generator. Techincally it is a simple
templating system based on eRuby, but it is designed 
with project templating squarely in mind.


== Installation

=== RubyGems Install

Install using RubyGems as you would expect:

  $ gem install sow

This will install Sow, it's Facets dependency if not alreay installed,
and a number of built-in plugins. Keep in mind that some plugins
come from the packages with which they are associated. For example,
the Reap plugin is distributed with the Reap package.

=== Site Install

Old-fashion site installs require Ruby Setup (see http://proutils.rubyforge.org/setup).
If you don't have Ruby Setup you can install it via Rubygems:

  $ gem install setup

With Setup in place, download the Sow tarball (.tar.gz) and unpack it,
then install by invoking setup.rb.

  $ tar -xvvzf sow-1.0.0.tar.gz
  $ cd sow-1.0.0 
  $ sudo setup.rb all


== Synopsis

In general usage is simply:

  sow [options] --<plugin>[=argument] ... [destination-path]

For instance to scaffold a new basic ruby project with the
name 'myapp' in the directory 'myapp':

  $ sow --ruby myapp

Once you have a project Sow can be used as a generator too.
First the project must be "sow-ready", which is as simple as
addig a .sow directory in the project's root folder.

For instance to generate a testunit file.

  $ cd myapp
  $ sow --testunit=mytest


== IGNORE

Scaffolds themselves support partial scaffolding when sow is in
generation mode. For instance you may want to add a standard
Rakefile. You can do that with Sow:

  $ sow --ruby[Rakefile]

Sow can also be used for general project templating. To do this, add
template files to the temps/ directory, reflecting the
same layout of your project. For example:

  myapp/
    lib/
      myapp/
        myapp.rb
    temps/
      lib/
        myapp/
          myapp.rb.erb
    meta/
      ...

Change into your project directory and type @sow@ with no arguments.

  $ sow

Project files will be generated based on the templates and your porjects
metadata.

== END IGNORE


For more details please see the documentation provided under doc/manual
or on Sow's website.



== Hoe Users

Hoe users will notice that the +sow+ command that comes with Hoe will
be overwritten by Sow. This may seem a shity thing to do, but truth be
told Sow is a slightly older project than Hoe (albeit orginally it was
very different program). Since there is no command called +hoe+, I 
recommend renaming Hoe's +sow+ command.

  sudo mv /usr/bin/sow /usr/bin/hoe

As an alternative, Sow ships with a How plug, so there is nothing lost even
if Hoe's +sow+ command is overwritten, simply use:

  $ sow --hoe <name>

Note, that Hoe scaffolding does not support the in-project templating
system. To get that you need to create a .meta/ directory to your project.


== Development

Sow is being developed on <a href="http://hithub.com">GitHub</a>, as part of the
ProUtils set of project development tools. You can browse the project here:

  http://github.com/proutils/sow/tree/master

Sow's public repository can be pulled via:

 	 git://github.com/proutils/sow.git 

Please feel free to fork the project and submit pull requests. Discussion of
Sow occurs on the TigerOps Community Mailinglist.

  http://groups.google.com/group/tigerops-community?hl=en

(For the moment you will have to sign up on Rubyforge before using the Google
Groups site.)
