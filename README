== TENDING TO PROJECT ECOLOGY

Sow is a project scaffolding system. The system is pluggable
and utilizes eRuby templating to make it easy to extend. Sow
can be used for any kind of file scaffolding, but it is
designed largely with Ruby project needs in mind.

Sow's plugins are called "seeds". Sowing requires seeds.
Sow comes with an extra large box of seeds to really get
those projects blooming!


== SYNOPSIS

General usage follws the pattern:

  sow [options] --<plugin>[=arg] --<plugin>.<var>[=arg] ... [destination]

For instance to scaffold a new, basic ruby project with the
name 'myapp' in the directory 'myapp':

  $ sow --ruby myapp/

By default, Sow's +ruby+ plugin will use the destination path
as the project name. If we wished to name the project something
other than the destination path, we can supply that as an argument.

  $ sow --ruby=foo myapp/

Alternately we could make the the directory ourselves and, and
scaffold it from within.

  $ mkdir myapp
  $ cd myapp
  $ sow --ruby=foo

Once you have a project, Sow can be used to generate components
as well, kind of like script/generate in Rails. For instance,
to generate a test/unit starter file.

  $ sow --testunit.name=mytest

For more details on how to use Sow, what plugins are available and how
to build your own cusotm plugins, please see the documentation
provided on Sow's website.


== CURRENT STATUS

Sow is still a little wet behind the ears, and you might come across
the ocassional odd behavior. Please report on the Protutils
mailing list (http://googlegroups.com/group/proutils). Usually the
issue will be some over-looked in a given plugin --since plugins
have a lot of flexability in their design. It will take some time
and some widespread usage to work out all the corner cases and
to bring each plugin to a fine polish.


== HOE USERS

*IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR HOE USERS!*

Hoe users will discover that the +sow+ command that comes with Hoe will
be overwritten by Sow. This may seem a not-so-nice thing to do, but truth
be told Sow is a slightly older project than Hoe (albeit orginally it was
a very different program). Since there is no command called +hoe+, I 
recommend renaming Hoe's +sow+ command.

  sudo mv /usr/bin/sow /usr/bin/hoe

As an alternative, Sow ships with a Hoe plugin, so there is nothing lost even
if Hoe's +sow+ command is overwritten, simply use:

  $ sow --hoe <name>

Note, that Hoe scaffolding does not support the in-project templating
system. To get that you need to add a .meta/ directory to your project.


== INSTALLATION

=== RubyGems Install

Install using RubyGems as you would expect:

  $ gem install sow

This will install Sow, it's Facets dependency if not alreay installed,
and a number of built-in plugins. Keep in mind that some plugins
come from the packages with which they are associated. For example,
the Reap plugin is distributed with the Reap package.

=== Old School Site Install

Old-fashion site installs require Ruby Setup (see http://proutils.rubyforge.org/setup).
If you don't have Ruby Setup you can install it via Rubygems:

  $ gem install setup

With Setup in place, download the Sow tarball (.tar.gz) and unpack it,
then install by invoking setup.rb.

  $ tar -xvvzf sow-1.0.0.tar.gz
  $ cd sow-1.0.0 
  $ sudo setup.rb all

If you use Hoe, please see the the important message below before
installing.


== DEVELOPMENT

Sow is being developed on <a href="http://hithub.com">GitHub</a>, as part of the
ProUtils set of project development tools. You can browse the Sow project here:

  http://github.com/proutils/sow/tree/master

Sow's public repository can be pulled via:

  git://github.com/proutils/sow.git 

Please feel free to fork the project and submit pull requests. Discussion of
Sow occurs on the TigerOps Community Mailinglist.

  http://groups.google.com/group/tigerops-community?hl=en

Happy hacking!
