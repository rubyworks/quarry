=============================================

## SYNOPSIS

  `quarry cucumber [features_directory]

## DESCRIPTION

Setup project for using cumcumber and place cucumber feature template
in project's mine for creating new cucumber feature files.

## ARGUMENTS

The cucuumber template takes one arguments.

  * `features_directory`
    The features directory (default `features/`).

This see will create the step_features and support directories
each with some minimal starter files to get up moving quickly.

If you are using a non-standard location for features, it's best
to provide the directory as an argument, but if not given an 
intelligent guess will be made by loolking to pre-existing `.feature`
files. If not found then it will fallback to `features`.
