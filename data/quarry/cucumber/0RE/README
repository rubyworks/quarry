quarry-cucumber(1) - create a cucumber feature
==============================================

## SYNOPSIS

  `sow cucumber <name> [directory]

## DESCRIPTION

Create a new cucumber feature file. If the project is not yet
setup for Cucumber then basic setup files will be provided in
addition to the feature file.

## ARGUMENTS

The cucuumber template takes two arguments.

  * `feature`:
    The name of the new feature (required).

  * `directory`
    The features directory (default `features/`).

This see will create the step_features and support directories
each with some minimal starter files to get up moving quickly.

If you are using a non-standard location for features, always be
sure to provide it as the second argument.
