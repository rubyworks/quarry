quarry-feature.cucumber(1) - setup for using cucumber
=====================================================

## SYNOPSIS

  `quarry feature.cucumber <feature_name> [features_directory]

## DESCRIPTION

Create a new cucumber feature.

## ARGUMENTS

The cucumber feature template takes two arguments.

  * `feature_name`
    The name of the feature (required).

  * `features_directory`
    The features directory (default `features/`).

If you are using a non-standard location for features, it's best
to provide the directory argument, but if not given an intelligent
guess is made by looking to pre-existing `.feature` files. If none
found then it will fallback to `features`.
